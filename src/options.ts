 * # Options
 *
 * These are the options for configuring a new {@link KullnaEditor} when calling {@link createEditor}.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Additional options are available for configuring the editor after initialization.
 * See the documentation for {@link KullnaEditor} for more information.
 *
 * Below is a comprehensive example of how to use these options. All of these options are optional,
 * but they are included here for your reference:
 *
 * ```js
 * const element = document.getElementById('editor');
 * const editor = KullnaEditor.createEditor(element, {
 *     window,
 *     tab: '  ',
 *     language: 'javascript',
 *     highlightElement: hljs.highlightElement,
 *     dir: 'ltr',
 *     maxUndoHistory: 300,
 *     gutter: {
 *         width: '55px',
 *         dir: 'ltr',
 *         class: 'gutter',
 *         customizer: (line, element) => {
 *             // Customize the line numbers in the gutter
 *         },
 *     },
 *     onUpdate: () => {
 *         // Handle changes to the editor's text
 *     },
 *     // TODO: onCursorUpdate(document: TextDocument) => void { }
 *     tabProcessor: {
 *         replacement: DefaultProcessors.tab({...
 *         })
 *     },
 *     enterProcessor: {
 *         indentOn: /[({\[]$/,
 *         moveToNewLine: /^[)}\]]/,
 *         preserveIndentation: true,
 *         replacement ? : DefaultProcessors.enter({...
 *         })
 *     },
 *     keydownProcessor: {
 *         replacement: DefaultProcessors.keydown({...
 *         })

   * in the options, but this value is unlikely to change over the lifetime of the editor, so it is
   * included here even though it can be changed after initialization at will.

   * presses the enter key, the newline processor inserts this value at the beginning of the new
   * line if the previous line ends with an open bracket. When we configure the default keydown
   * pipeline, we need this value to be consistent across all processors. So it has been "elevated"
