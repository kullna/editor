/**
 * # Throttled Action
 *
 * Will execute an action immediately, and then not execute it again until a certain amount of time
 * has passed - and only if the action has been triggered again. Useful for throttling events such
 * as screen refreshes - where instant feedback is important, but you don't want to refresh the
 * screen too often (note that this isn't a crutch for bad code - if you're refreshing the screen
 * too often (when content hasn't changed) you should probably fix that.) But in the face of a lot
 * of events, this can be useful to minimize wasted screen refreshes.
