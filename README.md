`@kullna/editor` is a browser-based code editor component developed and maintained by
[The Kullna Programming Language Project](http://www.kullna.org/).

As we were working on the Kullna IDE, we found the need for a reliable `contenteditable` code
editing surface with features like syntax highlighting, indentation management, line highlighting,
and a customizable gutter for adding breakpoints and bookmarks. For us, an essential requirement was
support for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages too.

Most of the existing editors were either too heavy and didn't work with RTL, or too simple and
didn't include sufficient features for our needs. We wanted a simple yet versatile editor that we
could easily extend to meet our specific needs, and which didn't break foundational features like
RTL support in the process. One that, if we needed to, we could maintain ourselves.

To address this gap, we're introducing `@kullna/editor`. A simple yet versatile code editor,
designed with extensibility in mind and built-in RTL support. If you're looking for a lightweight
code editor for your web application, we hope you'll find `@kullna/editor` useful, and we welcome
your feedback and contributions.
